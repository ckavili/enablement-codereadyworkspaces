## Deploying CodeReady Workspaces on OpenShift Container Platform

At the time of writing, the version targeted for CodeReady Workspaces was 2.0

More details can be found here:
- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_workspaces/2.0/
- https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview

### OpenShift Container Platform v4

CodeReady Workspaces are made available as an Operator based deployment that you can subscribe to through the Operator Lifecycle Manager. Please see the "Installing CodeReady Workspaces From Operator Hub" in the official [Installation Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_workspaces/2.0/html-single/installation_guide/index) for further details.

OR from the cli run:
```
# Create 'crw' Project and Deploy Operator
oc apply -f deploy/create-crw.yaml

# Create an instance of checluster.org.eclipse.che "codeready-workspaces"
oc apply -f deploy/org_v1_che_cr.yaml
```

### OpenShift Container Platform v3

`TBD`

- https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/installing-che-on-openshift-3-using-the-operator

```
oc new-project crw --display-name="CRW" --description='CRW'
crwctl server:start --platform=openshift --installer=operator --domain=<app domain> --tls --multiuser --os-oauth --chenamespace crw
```

## Custom Multi-Container Stack

This custom stack is intended for use in the DO500 course offered by Red Hat Training. The materials are available on GitHub. Since the technology is constantly changing this stack may fall out of date quickly.

- A shell script is provided to add the [raw config file](do500-raw-config.json). Modify the environment variables.
- An ansible playbook is also provided in the same manner as the shell script if you are more into that.

The tech stack and the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) used to build it is included. The stack includes RHEL7 UBI, NPM, Ansible, Mongo DB and the OC client.

<p class="tip">
<b>NOTE</b> - The rhel7.repo file needs to be edited to point to a valid repository when building.
</p>

## Use the devfile to create a workspace

Browse to the Code Ready Workspace factory URL link provided after installing CRW to launch your workspace in OpenShift:

```
https://codeready-workspaces.apps.cluster.example.com/f?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eformat/enablement-codereadyworkspaces/2.0/devfile.yaml"
```

## Use the nightwatch tests to pre-create the workspaces

Speed up the time in the classroom by pre-running the workspace generation. Ammend the `url` and the `lab` number in the `create-ws.js` file.

Run the test file:

```
npm i
npm install chromedriver --save-dev
for i in {01..14};do export LAB_NUMBER="lab$i"; echo "I is $LAB_NUMBER"; npx nightwatch create-ws.js; done
```
